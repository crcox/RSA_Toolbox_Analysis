# Here comes some fancy bash: apparently when you combine two or more brace
# expansions, you get the cartesian product of the two. That is:
#    {A,B}{1,2}
# Will produce:
#    A1
#    A2
#    B1
#    B2
#
# N.B. The right-most brace will be the inner-most loop during the combined
# expansion (A1, A2, then B1, B2).
#
# If you add a space between the two brace expressions, a space will be be
# included between the outputs. Therefore:
#    {A,B}" "{1,2}
# Will produce:
#    A 1
#    A 2
#    B 1
#    B 2
#
# This is convenient, because the space is used to separate array elements.
#
# In the following, the outer parenthesis are critical. It makes sure the
# evalation happens before assignment, and it encodes the expanded output as an
# array. Each element in the array is a pair of values. To continue the example
# from above:
#
#    x=({A,B}" "{1,2})
# Will permit the following commands and results (which are a bit indented):
#    echo ${x[0]}
#      A 1
#    echo ${x[3]}
#      B 2
#    y=(${x[1]})
#    echo ${y[0]}
#      A
#    echo ${y[1]}
#      2
